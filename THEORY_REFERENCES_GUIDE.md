# Theory and References Addition Guide

This document outlines the pattern for adding theory sections and references to all lessons.

## Pattern Established

### Theory Section
Add after the Introduction, before the main content. Should explain:
- **Why** the concept exists
- **Core principles** behind it
- **Key concepts** students need to understand
- **How it relates** to building operators

### References Section
Add before "Next Steps", after "Related Lab". Should include:
- **Official Documentation** - Kubernetes/Kubebuilder official docs
- **Further Reading** - Books, articles, blog posts
- **Related Topics** - Links to related concepts

## Example Structure
